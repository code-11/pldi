Suetonius himself, however, actually discounts these claims, and asserts that Caesar <i>said nothing</i> as he died, apart from a groan. His definite last words according to Suetonius were instead "Why, this is violence!" In Shakespeare's play, there is a little more to the quote. The full quote is: "Et tu, Brute? Then fall, Caesar." The entire quote means "Even [And] you, Brutus? Then all hope is lost and I shall fall." He thought Brutus would be on his side, but, discovering Brutus has stabbed him, gave up all hope of salvation.</li>

<li>In essence, the conflict that exists today is no more than an old-style struggle for power, once again presented to mankind in semireligious trappings. The difference is that, this time, the development of atomic power has imbued the struggle with a ghostly character; for both parties know and admit that, should the quarrel deteriorate into actual war, mankind is doomed. Despite this knowledge, statesmen in responsible positions on both sides continue to employ the well-known technique of seeking to intimidate and demoralize the opponent by marshaling superior military strength. They do so even though such a policy entails the risk of war and doom. Not one statesman in a position of responsibility has dared to pursue the only course that holds out any promise of peace, the course of supranational security, since for a statesman to follow such a course would be tantamount to political suicide.

<dd>These reportedly were his last words, spoken to Sergeant Jaime Terán, who in different accounts had either volunteered to be his executioner, or been selected by lot. Because of the many different reports that have arisen, much confusion and uncertainty exists about his actual last words. His last words to Colonel Arnaldo Saucedo Parada, head of intelligence of the Eighth Division who delivered the official report on Che's final moments were reported as: <b>"I knew you were going to shoot me; I should never have been taken alive. Tell Fidel that this failure does not mean the end of the revolution, that it will triumph elsewhere. Tell Aleida to forget this, remarry and be happy, and keep the children studying. Ask the soldiers to aim well."</b> Some also report his final words as those he reportedly declared when he surrendered: <b>"Don't shoot, I am Che Guevara and I am worth more to you alive than dead."</b> At one point early in the confusions General Ovando, Chief of Bolivian Armed Forces, declared that he had died in battle, and that just before dying he had declared: <b>"I am Che Guevara and I have failed"</b> these are sometimes accepted as his last words, though subsequent reports have generally discredited that initial account.

<ul>
<li>These are actually his last written words: They are the last paragraph of Che's last writing, "Bolivian Diary", which is the log Che kept during the Bolivian operations. Che is referring to information that he had about the ambush that the Bolivian army had prepared, and during which Che was arrested.</li>

<li>Translation: <b>I have been the king of Sweden.</b> Note: The German perfect of "be," "I have been," is constructed with a finite form of "be" (here "bin") and its participle ("gewesen"). Without "gewesen" at the end, one would translate "I am the king of Sweden." Thus the weight of the sentence rests on an untranslatable bit of grammatical cleverness. A roughly equivalent English phrasing would be "I am the king of Sweden… no more".</li>

<ul>
<li>Note: Whilst sitting in the back of a police car on the way to the hospital after the officers had asked him if he was John Lennon. While widely reported highly likely doubtful. "Yes, I am," in response to, "Are You John Lennon?" is frequently cited as Lennon's "Last Words." The myth is based on the story that the police officer did not recognize someone as famous as John Lennon (and Yoko would have been present too). This is actually a restatement or twisting of the question the officer did likely ask: "Do you know who you are" which would have been an attempt to determine Lennon's level of consciousness. Different versions have him answering or not in different manners, some state he said he was John Lennon. That is doubtful, Lennon's mouth was bleeding profusely at this point. More likely, the alternative version is accurate, that Lennon slightly nodded (or appeared to nod) and could only manage a gurgling sound from his throat before he lost consciousness totally. This concurs with reports of levels of severity of his injuries. Lennon's blood loss was so great, before the police arrived that the concierge at The Dakota realizing the severity of the injuries, simply covered Lennon with his uniform's jacket and removed his blood covered glasses then summoned police. Also, Lennon's last words of "I'm shot" were spoken seconds after he was shot as he staggered a number of steps toward the lobby of the Dakota. Sources for this include discussion in the Last Words reference book, Last Words of Notable People -- Final Words of More than 3500 Noteworthy People Throughout History by William B. Brahms which also cites the Lennon biography, John Ono Lennon Volume 2, 1967-1980 by Ray Coleman ).<sup id="cite_ref-18" class="reference"><a href="http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Last_words#cite_note-18">[18]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-19" class="reference"><a href="http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Last_words#cite_note-19">[19]</a></sup></li>

Just as Jesus Christ was lied on and slandered, so I have been treated the same way. I have no hatred. I know God is in control and I pray that he will forgive us of our sins, forgive the media people watching of their sins and all that they have done. As the Bible says, let those without sin cast the first stone. God forgave us all. To my family, I love you all. I know I did not live a good life.

<li>Note: Sedgwick was a Union Civil War general who was hit by sniper fire a few minutes after saying these, at the battle of Spotsylvania, on May 9, 1864. They are often portrayed as if they were his absolute final statement, the sentence often being presented as if he did not even finish it, and altered into the form: <i>"They couldn't hit an elephant at this dist…".</i> Though this may be a slightly more striking version of events, his actual last words are believed to be <b>"All right, my man; go to your place"</b>, in response to a soldier telling him that he preferred to duck when being shot at, even from a great distance. - (External link: <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.civilwarhome.com/sedgwickdeath.htm">Death of General John Sedgwick</a>)</li>
